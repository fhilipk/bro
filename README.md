THE DOG IDEA
=======

`dog`

It's more focused than `man` pages

It provides a few simple examples for command line tools

It's crowdsourced: all dog entries are editable by the community

THE WEB
-----------

The server still uses http://bropages.org for now. 

The server provides a REST API for CRUD of dog entries and upvotes
